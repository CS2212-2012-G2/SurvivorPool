TODO
====

If there is nothing written here, just grep the entire project for TODO

Admin (SWING)
------

	ALL
		- FORCE CHARACTER LIMIT FOR INPUT BOX (20 CHARS FOR NAMES, 30 FOR TRIBES)
			~ Just use a ChangeListener on the textfield in question and then 
				StatusPanel.setErrorMsg()
			~ I've gone through and checked all the input textfields, and they all seem to
			meet the project requirements. Is this an old TODO or is someone thinking
			of implementing a different way? - Jon
			
		- On a user input error, pass the component in error (or the associated 
		  	label) to a method in MainFrame that will some how show that its 
		  	invalid.
		  	~ Perhaps set the text to be Color.RED? This would be refreshed to 
		  		normal next time they try to save input 
		  	~ Is this one old as well? - Jon
		
	Main.java
		
		- IMPLEMENT THEMES
			- MARK WHICH THEME IS ACTIVE AT START
				activeTheme.setSelected() or could use doClick() which would programatically call the action listener associated
			- Create action listeners for each item to set the theme
			- Set how to iterate updating items, easiest is probably setting most objects to have transparent backgrounds
				~ would theses all be set on low priority due to the 
				 	TA's comments on us already meeting the style requirement? - Jon
		
	GeneralPanel.java
	
		- MAKE IT LOOK BETTER!
			~ I don't see what else we could improve on, at least in the context of our assignment requirements. 
				If you have a specific suggestion, add it in please - Jon
		
	data
	~~~~
		- Document ComparatorFactory (its piss easy.)

	ContestantPanel
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
		- Get the table to reselect the row after you reorder the columns
		- Add a way to change the cast off date
		- Implement loading a "blank" contestant when clicking add
	
	PlayerPanel
	~~~~~~~~~~~
		- Add focus events to highlight the text in the box. Its annoying
		  having to manually highlight the text. Obviously low priority
		
	SeasonCreatePanel.java
		
		- MAKE IT LOOK BETTER!
			~ I'm pretty happy with how it looks now, what were you thinking of improving? - Jon

	- MAKE THEME ACTUALLY LOOK GOOD(LOW PRIORITY)
		~ I think they already look good.. (Kevin)
		~ Agreed, and the TA in the meeting said ours met the quality needed - Jon

Data
----

	GameData
		- Check what needs to be abstracted and what doesn't
		- JSON might not need to be
		- Sorting will need to be done in the subclass and methods overridden where necessary
		
	Contestant & User
		- Make as little abstract as possible (saves time for Jon)
			~ With J2ME JSON, one should be able to use all the same JSON methods
			~ Pretty sure admin version is obsolete
