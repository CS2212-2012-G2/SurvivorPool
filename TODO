	ALL
		- FORCE CHARACTER LIMIT FOR INPUT BOX (20 CHARS FOR NAMES, 30 FOR TRIBES)
			~ Just use a ChangeListener on the textfield in question and then 
				StatusPanel.setErrorMsg()
		- Spacing for all the tabbed panels so they aren't butted right up against it
		- On a user input error, pass the component in error (or the associated 
		  	label) to a method in MainFrame that will some how show that its 
		  	invalid.
		  	~ Perhaps set the text to be Color.RED? This would be refreshed to 
		  		normal next time they try to save input 
		
	Main.java
		
		- CHANGE TAB SIZE
		- IMPLEMENT THEMES
			- MARK WHICH THEME IS ACTIVE AT START
				activeTheme.setSelected() or could use doClick() which would programatically call the action listener associated
			- Create action listeners for each item to set the theme
			- Set how to iterate updating items, easiest is probably setting most objects to have transparent backgrounds
		- Make the season create panel have the main menu bar
		
	GeneralPanel.java
	
		- MAKE IT LOOK BETTER!

		- Implement loading a "blank" contestant when clicking add
		- Implement all things disabled when no contestant is "active" in the panel.
	
	PlayerPanel

		- Make the names of the Contestants be displayed intelligently in the 
		  ComboBoxs while NOT making our debugging miserable.
		- Implement adding and removing of Users
		- EVERYTHING!

	data
	~~~~
		ALL: 
			Add documentation, the overridden methods do not need it (they 
			inheret there parents), but if their parents are not done, do them.

Data
----

	GameData
		- Check what needs to be abstracted and what doesn't
		- JSON might not need to be
		- Sorting will need to be done in the subclass and methods overridden where necessary
		
	Contestant & User
		- Make as little abstract as possible (saves time for Jon)
			~ With J2ME JSON, one should be able to use all the same JSON methods
			~ Pretty sure admin version is obsolete
