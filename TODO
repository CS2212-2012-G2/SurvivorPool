	Main.java
		
		- CHANGE TAB SIZE
		- IMPLEMENT THEMES
			- MARK WHICH THEME IS ACTIVE AT START
				activeTheme.setSelected() or could use doClick() which would programatically call the action listener associated
			- Create action listeners for each item to set the theme
			- Set how to iterate updating items, easiest is probably setting most objects to have transparent backgrounds
		- Implement a "status bar" at the bottom of the screen to show messages
