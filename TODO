TODO

If there is nothing written here, just grep the entire project for TODO

Admin (SWING)
------

	ALL
		- FORCE CHARACTER LIMIT FOR INPUT BOX (20 CHARS FOR NAMES, 30 FOR TRIBES)
			~ Just use a ChangeListener on the textfield in question and then 
				StatusPanel.setErrorMsg()
		- On a user input error, pass the component in error (or the associated 
		  	label) to a method in MainFrame that will some how show that its 
		  	invalid.
		  	~ Perhaps set the text to be Color.RED? This would be refreshed to 
		  		normal next time they try to save input 
		
	Main.java
		
		- IMPLEMENT THEMES
			- MARK WHICH THEME IS ACTIVE AT START
				activeTheme.setSelected() or could use doClick() which would programatically call the action listener associated
			- Create action listeners for each item to set the theme
			- Set how to iterate updating items, easiest is probably setting most objects to have transparent backgrounds
		- Make the season create panel have the main menu bar
		
	GeneralPanel.java
	
		- MAKE IT LOOK BETTER!
		
	data
	~~~~
		- Document ComparatorFactory (its piss easy.)

	ContestantPanel
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
		- EVERYTHING!
		- Get the table to reselect the row after you reorder the columns
		- Add a way to change the cast off date
		- Display "Active" by default when making a new contestant
		- Implement loading a "blank" contestant when clicking add
	
	PlayerPanel
	~~~~~~~~~~~
		- Add focus events to highlight the text in the box. Its annoying
		  having to manually highlight the text. Obviously low priority
		- EVERYTHING!
		
	SeasonCreatePanel.java
		
		- MAKE IT LOOK BETTER!
		- 

	-MAKE THEME ACTUALLY LOOK GOOD(LOW PRIORITY)
		~ I think they already look good.. (Kevin)
		~ Agreed, and the TA said ours met the quality needed in the meeting.. (Jon)

Data
----

	GameData
		- Check what needs to be abstracted and what doesn't
		- JSON might not need to be
		- Sorting will need to be done in the subclass and methods overridden where necessary
		
	Contestant & User
		- Make as little abstract as possible (saves time for Jon)
			~ With J2ME JSON, one should be able to use all the same JSON methods
			~ Pretty sure admin version is obsolete
