	ALL
		- FORCE CHARACTER LIMIT FOR INPUT BOX (20 CHARS FOR NAMES, 30 FOR TRIBES)
			~ Just use a ChangeListener on the textfield in question and then 
				StatusPanel.setErrorMsg()
			~ I've gone through and checked all the input textfields, and they all seem to
			meet the project requirements. Is this an old TODO or is someone thinking
			of implementing a different way? - Jon
			~ No, this was to proactively stop people. But I think we
			  can scrap this since we have the warnings. - kb
		
	Main.java
		
		- IMPLEMENT THEMES
			- MARK WHICH THEME IS ACTIVE AT START
				activeTheme.setSelected() or could use doClick() which would programatically call the action listener associated
			- Create action listeners for each item to set the theme
			- Set how to iterate updating items, easiest is probably setting most objects to have transparent backgrounds
				~ would theses all be set on low priority due to the 
				 	TA's comments on us already meeting the style requirement? - Jon
				~ this is already done, the themes at start
				  is not, but I asked justin and he claimed to
				  want to do it. - kb
