Help for using git:
Always do git fetch before working
    git fetch
If you create a new file, do git add .

If you are done working on a specific task, do
    git commit -a
This will allow you to write a message of what you changed(added)

If the fix was small(ie spelling mistake) just do
    git commit -am 'enter what you did (ie. fixed spelling mistake'

After you do a commit, or commits, do
    git push -u origin master
This syncs the github website with the content you added/changed, so everyone
else has access to it.

I'll add branching soon, considering it will be very useful in a few weeks.
