5. Up until the point that the game starts the administrative user should 
be able to change/add/delete contestants, change names, tribes, unique 
ids and pictures. The admin user should always be allowed to change the 
tribe name, even after the game has started.

- After starting a new season (File > Reset Season), click the Contestant
tab to open the Contestant section of the admin application. To add a
contestant, fill out the correct required information (first, last, id, 
picture: click the picture box and find the file),and then hit "add new". 
Since the season hasn't yet started, you are able to edit an already made 
contestant by selecting the contestant's row in the table, editing the data 
in the label boxes, and hitting "save". To start the season, go to the 
"general" tab, and hit the "start season button". Now, all the admin can 
edit is the tribe names, which was always avaliable to change at the bottom 
of the general tab, by just editing the field of your choosing and hitting 
"change tribe name".

6. The administrative user should be able to add office workers (players) 
until the game starts. Once the game starts the administrative user can 
not add or delete any more players but he/she can modify players (except 
for the userid)

- see #5, except instead of the contestant tab, its the player
tab.

10. The adminstrative user must be able to list all the contestants by 
unique id or first name, or last name or team or by elimination round/order.

within the table within the contestants tab by clicking the required column
header

11. The administrative user must be able to list all the players by first 
name or last name or userid or by total score so far.

- Follow the same sets as #5 to create players. You can sort players
within the table within the players tab by clicking the required column
header

12. The administrative user must be able to start the game (at this point 
no new players or contestants can be added). At this point the administrative 
user should also enter the amount of money that each player is going to pitch 
in (for example each player might be pitching in 5 dollars or 1 dollar).

- As discussed in #5, once the required amount of contestants are added, the
admin is able to start the season at the bottom of the general tab. After
pressing the "start season" button, a pop-up asks for your required weekly 
bet amount. 

13. The administrative user must be able display the standings for all 
the players (which player has which score). This could be displayed as 
an HTML web page or within the program.

- This is included in the requirements for #11.

14. The administrative user must be able to indicate for each round/week, 
who was eliminated. For testing purposes, the administrative user can do 
this at any time (they don't have to wait till the end of the week)

- when the administrator wants to cast off a contestant, they should start
the season, and select the contestant from the contestant tab table list, and
hit "cast off". To cancel a cast off, just hit cast off again while selecting
the contestant.

Assignment 2

4a4
Admin Data Persistence Example: When creating a new season in the admin side,
data such as the number of contestants is generated by the user and output to
a data flat file for usage later.
BB Data Persistence Example: The Blackberry log in screen reads input from a flat 
file userData. It takes data from the file, extracts the userIDs of all users,
 and then checks to see if the inputted log in was successful.

1. The administrative user must be able to enter the number of Survivor contestants 
this year. This number must be greater than or equal to 6 but less than or equal to 
15.
	- This is done at the Season Start screen, the data file must NOT be
	  present currently for this to show.

2. The administrative user must be able to add the names, first and last of each 
contestant, unique id for each contestant and the tribe names of each contestant. 
The first and last name must be 1-20 characters long, the unique id must be 2 
characters long, where the characters can only be numbers or letters, it must be
case insensitive. 
The tribe name must be 1-30 characters long.
	- This can be tested by navigating to the "Player" tab, then adding 
	  information and pressing Save. It is not fully implemented, and 
	  bugs exist. 
	- "Add" will add a clean player to the interface
	- "Delete" is NOT functional
	- Use "Cast Off" to cast a player off

3. The administrative user should be able to upload a picture for each user. 
(For testing purposed just use any .gif or .jpg of a head shot)
	- Simply click on the picture to add another picture. These pictures
	  have their path saved, but not their data.
	  ~ Should we be saving the data internally?

4. The last week of Survivor always has 3 contestants, so the system should calculate 
how many weeks the show will run based on the number of contestants and based on the 
fact that one person will be voted off each week until there are 3 left. 
This indicates how many rounds there will be.
	- This is done in the Season Start screen at the begining of the
	  Admin GUI start
	- Click on the spinners to change the values, the other will adjust
	  as appropriate.

7. When adding a player, the administrative user must enter Unique userid - this 
id should be the same as the western userid: first initial, last name up to 6 
character and then a number if that first initial and 1-6 characters are already used
	- This will be generated based off first name and last name
	- Currently we do not display these, but this will be implemented
	  similarly to the Contestants for showing the data

8. When adding a player, the administrative user must enter First name - 1 to 20 
letters
	- Warnings occur if smaller than 1 char, or larger than 20. 
	  The player will not be added.
	- this also works for contestants (in a cleaner, prettier fashion)

9. When adding a player, the administrative user must enter Last name - 1 to 20 
letters
	- Warnings occur if smaller than 1 char, or larger than 20. 
	  The player will not be added.

10. The adminstrative user must be able to list all the contestants by 
    unique id or first name, or last name or team or by elimination 
    round/order.
	- Add multiple contestants, click on the table headers. They will
	  sort "lowest to highest" according to lexographics or int value.

27. This system must allow the player to: enter his/her userid
	- Test by creating users/players and then entering in the desired 
	  userID, then press the log in button. Valid userIDs will reach the
	  main menu, invalid ones will have their input field cleared for
	  another log in attempt. current taken from the userData flat file.
